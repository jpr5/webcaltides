<p class="lead">
WebCalTides is a free service that provides tides, currents and sunrise/sunset calendars for your favorite tide stations.  Data is pulled from NOAA (US/etc) and DFO-CHS (Canada). Just search for a station, then click the webcal link to subscribe.  Works on Apple iCal & Google Calendar; maybe Outlook too.

    <em><b>Update 12/2023</b>: The logic was improved to include 1 year before + ahead of the current month.  This solves the issue of calendars running out before EOY -- before, calendars only had data for current year, and would only show the next year starting Jan 1.</em>
