<h1 class="display-4">WebCalTides Service</h1>

<p class="lead">
WebCalTides is a free service that provides tides, currents and sunrise/sunset calendars for your favorite NOAA station.  Data is pulled from <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html">tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov</a>. Just search for a station, then click the webcal link to subscribe.  Works on Apple iCal & Google Calendar; maybe Outlook too.

    <em>Update: More international/non-US stations coming soon.  Sourcing as many of the old harmonics files as I can find (before they were privatized), then will wire up to XTide.  Drop me a note if you've got something to share...</em>
